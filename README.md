# Restaurant-Review-Analysis---NLP
This repository contains Lexicon-based analysis for restaurant reviews.

This type of analysis, such as the NLTK Vader sentiment analyzer, involves using a set of predefined rules and heuristics to determine the sentiment of a piece of text. These rules are typically based on lexical and syntactic features of the text, such as the presence of positive or negative words and phrases.

## Installation
